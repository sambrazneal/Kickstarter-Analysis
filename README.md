# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project 

In this module, students were to analyze the outcomes of different fundraisers in different categories to determine the best fundraising tactic for Lousie’s play, Fever. 

Louise is looking to start a fundraising campaign to fund her play “Fever. She has estimated the budget for around $10,000. She needs help to analyze the Kickstarter data to see what makes a project successful. 

### Purpose 
Louise has turned to us to determine if there are certain factors that make a campaign successful. At the end of the analysis Louise will know what makes a campaign successful, and how she and other fundraisers can ensure their campaign meets its goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges 

Starting with the raw data, we knew that we would need to be sorted and filtered to be better prepared for the analysis. We added a few new columns to dive even further into the analysis. 

The first data set that we analyzed was the outcomes for the different parent categories. We found that theatre campaigns were the most used and most successful. So, that is great news for Louise. 





Next, we analyzed the data for the subcategories. Plays was the winner for subcategory outcomes being the most used and the most successful. Another win for Louise. Plays had a 65% success rate. 








### Difficulties and Challenges 
-	With a large data set like this one, there is always the chance that one of your formulas in the worksheet can get altered and become a problem. Make sure to double check your formulas, and autofill any formulas you think may have gotten altered.
-	Getting a data set from an unknown source, misspelt words could cause a problem when trying to filter and sort. If you find any errors or misspelt words, you can use the find function to search and correct and misspellings. 

## Results 

  Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
Moving into more specific data that relates better to Louise’s goals. We analyzed the theater outcomes relative to launch dates. We found that May is the most successful month to host a campaign and December is the least. Louise should make sure any future theater campaigns should be launched in the summer months, as they tend to be the most successful. 





  Analysis of Play Outcomes Based on Goals

Lastly, the analysis on the outcome for play fundraisers based on fundraising goals. In Louise’s category, $10,000 to $14,999 campaigns for plays are 54% successful. 






















### Conclusions

Theater Outcomes Vs Launch Date 
* Timing of a campaign is critical to the success. Try to schedule a campaign for May or June as they have the best success rates (67% and 65%, respectively).
* January and December are the worst months to host a campaign with success rates of 58% and 49%, respectively. 

Play Outcomes Vs Goals 
-	Campaigns with less than a $5,000 goal were the most successful with over 70% success rate. 
-	Louise has a 54% chance of success with a goal of $10,00. 


Limitations 
-	The data set is outdated. To provide a current analysis for Louise, a more recent data set should be used. 
-	I also think more in-depth information about each campaign would be helpful to Louise such as marketing efforts.

Further Analysis 

I was curious to see the length of campaigns and their success rate.  I used a formula to generate the number of days in a campaign from the start and end dates and used a line chart to show the outcomes. The average number of days for a campaign is 33 days. This helps Louise know how long she should host her campaign.
